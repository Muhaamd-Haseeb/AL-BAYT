                <p> Hey guys! It's awesome to have you all here! I'm Hamza,  from GIFT University and a sophomore pursuing Bachelors of Science in COmputer Science.
                  I like to believe, I'm a creative guy with interests in photography, abstract art, Programming and design. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  I am an easy going person who'd like to think that he has a good sense of humor, haha. I spend most of my time either gaming or consuming random YouTube videos, so yea I'm your average guy.
                </p>
               
                <p>I'm one of the few persons who love Data Structures and Algorithms. I'm sticking to strengthening my basics yet so not an appropriate one if you're looking for a person who can develop flashy apps on Web and Android.</p>

             <p> I am a student of COmputer Science in 2nd year, studying at GIFT University Gujranwala. I am a Lead in Graphics Designing team of Developer Students Club, DSC and I really love to be a part of it.
             </p>
             <p>
              Taking about my behaviour, I am a very lazy person xD, I repeat, very lazy but when it comes to an assigned work, I do it with all my heart and put all my effort to make it happen.
              I think myself as a funny person, sometimes shararti(naughty), prankster ( got wrong also ðŸ˜‚) but I like to work with my team as a friend ðŸ˜Š. When its time to be serious, no one is more serious than me(ðŸ˜‚). I am very much addicted to movies(Hero, Action & Horror), k- dramas are my heart ( goblin, touchable).
             </p>
            <p>I am  professional programmer as I desired to be but I target to work in Android and I am working on it. Alhumdulillah, I am 80% successful in it and currently I am also studying Kubernetes, online.</p>

             <p> This is Haseeb, who mistakenly bumped into the world of machines and technology. Nevertheless, here I am, an amateur writer, Computer Science undergrad Student @GIFT University, a Manchester United fanatic,passionate about stars and galaxies and not at all a morning person.
              Actually too lazy to write paragraphs so deal with the next part.
              </p>
             <p>
              Have you ever heard of laughing hyena? Yeah, that's me.
              Besides Monday, I hate Wednesday too.
              The Internet is my school.
              Just canâ€™t raise my grades. CGPA for adoption.
             </p>
             <p>I am in a quest to fulfill the duty for which i am born.
              Loves everything that plays even a little role the improvement of people's life.</p>
